## Introduction

	Welcome to our project, an initiative of the TinkerHub Community. We’ve created a collaborative learning space where both new and existing members can connect, share, and grow together.

	TinkerHub provides a ‘First Time at TinkerSpace? Register Yourself!’ form and a ‘Make Your Attendance Every Visit!’ form. These tools help us create an engaging and productive environment for co-learners.
	
	However, as our community grows, connecting learners and mentors can become challenging. To address this, we’ve developed a solution: when submitting the ‘Make Your Attendance Every Visit!’ form, members can now indicate whether they are a mentor or a mentee. This information, along with their name, the framework they’re learning, and their picture, is displayed on a TV screen at TinkerSpace. This feature makes it easier for members to identify and connect with each other.
	
	We believe this project will enhance the learning experience at TinkerHub by facilitating easier connections between members. We also encourage contributors to add new features and improvements to this project. Let’s learn, build, and grow together with TinkerHub Community!
